# Bitcoin-Candle-Condicional-Probability
This .py code calculates the condicional probability of the next candle after a consequence of green or red candles. 


This code calculates the conditional probability of a green or red candle appearing after a given number of consecutive green or red candles in the Bitcoin price from 14/03/2014 to 14/04/2023.

The user is prompted to input the number of consecutive candles to analyze. The code then reads in a CSV file containing the daily closing and opening prices of Bitcoin and calculates the number of green and red candles as well as the number of consecutive green and red candles.

The conditional probabilities are calculated using the number of times a green or red candle appears after a given number of consecutive green or red candles. The resulting probabilities are printed to the console.

Please note that this is an empirical probability, based on historical data, and should not be interpreted as a guarantee of future performance.

The CSV file used in this code is the Bitcoin 1 day chart from 14/03/2014 to 14/04/2023, obtained from Bitfinex.
